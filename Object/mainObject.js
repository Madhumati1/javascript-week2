//-------------Syntax Object-------------------

//An Object is an unordered collection of properties. An Object is comprised of name, value pairs.

var students =  new Object();

//the [] brackets are an operator that takes the students object and sets the property using a string
students["FristName"] = "MAdhu";
students["surname"] = "NotRealSurname";

console.log(students);
// created a var hold yhe students firstNAme to return is/
var firstNameProperty = "firstName";

console.log(students[firstNameProperty]);
 //this is better practice  howerver, the syntax parser will understand both.

console.log(students.FristName);
console.log(students.surname);

students.address = new Object();

// the dot works from to right creating new name value pairs.
students.address.doorNumber = 150;
students.address.roadNumber = "Minories";
students.address.postcode = "EC1 XYZ";

// check the nested object within memory
console.log(students);

console.log(students.address.doorNumber);

//declaring an Object
// whenever the syntax parser sees the curly brackets will be viewed as a new object
